      <p>“My granddaughters favorite, I have to make them each year for her birthday. I get requests for them all the time from family and co-workers. Easy and oh so good. Nothing says ‘I love you’ more than home made cupcakes.”</p>

      <p>“Just made these. Whole family loved them, everyone had two! SUPER moist and the frosting is great, but pretty sweet, not that I am complaining. ;) Definitely would recommend these to anyone who loves red velvet! I had a compliment that was: ‘Usually in red velvet cakes, it just tastes like yellow cake with food coloring. I can actually taste the cocoa and the moistness is spot on.’”</p>
